Check out this thrilling blog action!\r\n------------------------------\r\n \r\nThat's right, JenJin Studios now has an official blog. I have to confess, I didn't completely write the blog functionality from scratch, like most other things here.  In order to get some fancy formatting going on here, I toyed with the idea of porting [GitHub Flavored Markdown][1] into JavaScript (because who wants to use Ruby?), but then I realized that that would be a nightmarishly huge project to take on in what free time isn't taken up by taking care of a baby (I don't know Ruby, and, let's face it, I'm just figuring out how to do any of this stuff as I go).  Instead, I decided to be sensible and use [pagedown][2], which is an open source JavaScript library for converting markdown into html code.  Apparently [Stack Overflow][3] utilizes it, so now the only thing I have to worry about is that people will be wanting to suggest fixes for everything writen on here...\r\n\r\nSo, what *will* be written on here? **Who knows?** Caleb hasn't told me what he's planning on posting here, so I sure don't. I imagine there's going to be news on the progress of the JenJin Framework, as well as some coding tips that will likely be in Java. Maybe I'll even post a few things here, such as my blundering misadventures in programming, or perhaps (if I'm feeling especially generous) even some of my deep philosophical insights. As I doubt anyone would actually want to look at that, it would probably have to go into it's own section, or I might have to revive [my old blog][4] that I haven't looked at in over a year...\r\n \r\n -Garrett \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/gist.github.com\/mojombo\/118964\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/pagedown\/\r\n  [3]: http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/\r\n  [4]: http:\/\/gcalps.blogspot.com\/2012\/03\/hypocracy.html
